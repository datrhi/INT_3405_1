2. Choose public dataset: https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/vehicles-openimages/
3. Write dataset analysis and dataset report
4. Write training pipeline
# Phase 2:
1. Implement yolov3 with pytorch-lightning
2. Train and report results (chart, example image, ...)
3. Compare with other methods
